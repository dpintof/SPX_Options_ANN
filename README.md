# SPX_Options_ANN
Public repository for the code related to my Master's thesis. My e-mail is: dpintof@disroot.org

Work related to the paper Ke and Yang (2019) Option Pricing with Deep Learning. My code is inspired by what the authors made publicly available: https://github.com/ycm/cs230-proj. The objective is to price/evaluate vanilla options (financial derivatives) using different kinds of neural networks.
